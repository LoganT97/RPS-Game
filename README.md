Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in JavaScript.

How to Play

To play, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. This will prompt you to enter your selection (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) for each round of the game. The computer will randomly select its choice for each round, and the winner will be determined according to the standard Rock, Paper, Scissors rules.

Implementation Details

The game logic is implemented in JavaScript using a combination of functions and loops. The playRound function takes two arguments (the player's selection and the computer's selection) and returns the result of that round. The game function loops through five rounds of the game, prompting the player for their selection each time and displaying the result of the round. The getComputerChoice function generates a random computer selection for each round.
